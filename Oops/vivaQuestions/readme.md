## Oops Questions
#### What is meant by the term OOps?
OOPs refers to Object-Oriented Programming . It is a Programming model which is based upon Object and Classes . Objects can be considered as real-world instances of entities like class, that have som characteristics and behaviors.

#### What is the need for OOPs?
There are many reasons why OOPs is mostly preferred, but the most important among them are :
- It helps understant the software easily
- Big code can be easily written and managed 
- It makes the code readable and understandable

#### What are some major Object Orient3ed Programming Languages?
1. Java
2. C++
3. Javascript
4. Python

#### What is meant by Structured Programming ?
Structured Programming refers to the method of programming which consists of a completely structured control flow. Here structure refers to a block , which contains a set of rules , and has a definitive control flow , such as (if/else), (while and for)  .

#### What are the main features of OOps?
OOps are Object Oriented Programming mainly Conprises of the below four Features . 
1. Inheritance 
2. Encapsulation
3. Polymorphism
4. Data Abstraction

#### What are some advantages of using OOps?
- OOps is very helpful in solvind very complex level of problems.
- OOps promote code reuse, thereby reducing redundancy
- OOps also helps to hide the unnecessary details with the help of Data Abstraction
- OOps are based on a botton-up approach , unlike the Structural Programming which uses a top-down approach.
- Polymorphism offers a lot of flexibility in OOps.

#### What is a class?
A class can be understood as a template or a blueprint, which contains some values, known as member data or member functions. So when an object is created , it automatically takes the data and functions that are defined in the class. Therefore the class is basically a template or blueprint for objects.

#### What is an object ?
An Object refers to the instance of the class, which contains the instance of the memebers . In the real world , an object is an actual entity to which a user interacts, whereare class is just the blueprint for that object. So the object consumes space .

#### What is encapsulation ?
All the necessary data and methods are bind together and all the unnecessary details are hidden to the normal user. So Encapsulation is the process of binding data members and methods of a program together to do specific job, without revealing unnecessary details

Encapsulation can also be defined in two different ways:
1. Data hiding : Encapsulation is the process of hiding unwanted information, Such as resticting access to any member of an object.
2. Data Binding: Encapsulation is the process of binding the data members and the methods together as a whole , as a class.

#### What is Polymorphism ?
Polymorphism is composed of two world - "Poly" which means "many" and "morph" means "forms" . Therefor Polymorphism refers to something that has many forms. 
There are 2 typw of polymorphism 
1. Compile time polymorphism
2. Run time polymorphism
