# Polymorphism

Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on many forms. The most common use of polymorphism in OOP occurs when a parent class reference is used to refer to a child class object.

### Types of Polymorphism

- Compile Time
- Run Time , Dynamic Binding , Late Binding

#### Compile Time

Also called as static Binding , Early Binding.

#### Method Overloading

| Method Overloading                                                                                    | Method Overriding                                                                                   |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| More than one method with same name , different prototype in same scope is called method overloading. | More than one method with same name , same prototype in different scope is called method Overriding |
| In Case of method overloading, parameter must be different                                            | In case of method overriding , parameter must be same                                               |
| Method overloading is the example of compile time polymorphism.                                       | Method overriding is the example of run time polymoriphism.                                         |
| Method Overloading is performed within class                                                          | Method overriding occurs in two classes                                                             |
| In case of method overloading Return tupe can be same or different .                                  | In case of method overriding Return Type must be same.                                              |

Important Question
Differentiate between run-time Polymorphism and compile time Polymorphism
```

Answer

| Run Time Polymorphism | Compile Time Polymorphism |
| --------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Method Overriding     | Method Overloading        |
